My very first DevOps project introduced me to one of the most important notions of DevOps: containerization. 

It made me learn how to use one of the leading associated technologies on the market: Docker.

I created several images using Dockerfiles and coordinate their creation and deployment using Docker Compose. 

In the end, with a simple one-line command, I was able to deploy a fully containerized set of applications together, anytime, anywhere, without the need to switch between operating systems to make everything work. And that is super cool.
